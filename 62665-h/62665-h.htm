<h1><i>Classic Variations in Cooking with Texas Eggs</i></h1>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_i">i</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Foreword</span></h2>
<p>This recipe book has been designed to demonstrate the versatility of
cooking with Texas eggs. There are dishes that range from elegant Eggs
Benedict to simple scrambled eggs. The many ways to add protein to the
diet through the use of Texas eggs are included here in suggestions for main
dishes, snacks, and desserts.</p>
<p>Basic instructions on the most common preparation of Texas eggs
serve as the introduction to the book. There are also sections on French
dishes, Tex-Mex favorites, American and international entrees, and
desserts.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of Agriculture is most grateful to the
American Egg Board, which granted us permission to reprint their recipes
and the interesting comments on dishes which compose most of the book.
Many of the color photographs also were provided by the American Egg
Board.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">A Note About Texas Eggs</span></h2>
<p>An egg is an egg is an egg?</p>
<p>Maybe so, say some cooks. After all, the national egg industry
functions under the same sanitation regulations, the same standards on
grading for quality and size. But most Texans believe that there is
something better about foods produced close to home.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re taking the time to prepare foods that are appealing,
attractive, and nutritious, serve the best&mdash;fresh, wholesome eggs from
Texas.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Following A Recipe That Calls For Eggs</span></h2>
<p>1. <b>Slightly beaten</b>: Use a fork or whisk to beat eggs just until the
yolks and whites are blended.</p>
<p>2. <b>Well beaten</b>: Use a mixer or blender to beat eggs until they are
light, frothy and evenly colored.</p>
<p>3. <b>Thick and lemon-colored</b>: Beat yolks in a mixer for about 5
minutes or in a blender for about 2 minutes until they become a pastel
yellow and form ribbons when the beater is lifted or they are dropped from
a spoon.</p>
<p>4. <b>Stiff but not dry</b>: Beat whites with a mixer or whisk until they no
longer slip when the bowl is tilted.</p>
<p>5. <b>Gently folded</b>: When combining beaten egg whites with other
heavier mixtures, handle carefully so that the air beaten into the whites is
not lost. It&rsquo;s best to pour the heavier mixture onto the beaten egg whites.
Then gradually combine the ingredients with a rubber spatula, turning the
bowl slowly. Don&rsquo;t stir.</p>
<p>6. <b>Separating whites and yolks</b>: There are various kitchen gadgets on
the market which will separate eggs, but the most common method is to
crack the egg in the center and shift the yolk from one half of the egg shell
to the other, allowing the white to slip into a bowl and being careful not to
break the yolk. Eggs are easiest to separate when cold, but whites reach
their fullest volume if allowed to stand at room temperature for about 30
minutes before beating.</p>
<p>7. <b>Cook until coats a metal spoon</b>: For stirred custard mixtures, the
eggs are cooked properly when a thin film adheres to a metal spoon dipped
into the custard.</p>
<p>8. <b>Cook until a knife inserted near center comes out clean</b>: Baked
custard mixtures are done when a metal knife inserted off center comes out

<p><span class="lr">2 servings</span></p>
<p><i>In a book titled &ldquo;The Old Virginia Gentleman,&rdquo; its author, George Bagby,
describes scrambled eggs as a &ldquo;necessary.&rdquo; For breakfast, for sandwiches, or as the
original skillet supper, families all over the country agree with Mr. Bagby.</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">4 eggs</p>
<p class="t0">&frac14; C. milk</p>
<p class="t0">&frac12; tsp. salt</p>
<p class="t0">Dash pepper</p>
<p class="t0">2 T. butter</p>
</div>
<p>Beat together eggs, milk, salt and pepper with a fork, mixing thoroughly for
uniform yellow, or just slightly for white and yellow streaks. Heat butter in 8-inch
fry pan over medium heat until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Pour in
egg mixture. As mixture begins to set, turn a pancake turner over and gently draw
completely across the bottom of pan, forming large soft curds. Continue until eggs
are thickened, but do not stir constantly. Cook until eggs are thickened throughout
but still moist.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>In fry pan over medium-high heat, cook butter until just hot enough to sizzle a
drop of water. (If a very large pan is used, more butter will be needed.)</p>
<p>Break and slip eggs into pan. Reduce heat immediately. Cook slowly to
desired doneness, spooning butter over eggs to baste or turning eggs to cook both
sides. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<h3 id="c7">POACHED EGGS</h3>
<p><i>The word poach comes from the French <b>pocher</b> which means to place in a
pocket. Properly poached, the yolk is pocketed smoothly in the white. Breaking
each egg into a saucer before slipping it into the water is gentler than cracking it
directly in, and prevents mishaps.</i></p>

over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to keep water at a simmer.</p>
<p>Break eggs, one at a time, into dish, then slip each egg into water, holding dish
close to water&rsquo;s surface. Simmer 3 to 5 minutes depending on desired doneness.
When done, lift eggs with slotted pancake turner or spoon onto absorbent paper.
Drain and trim edges, if desired.</p>

<p><span class="lr">4 servings</span></p>
<p><i>Baking is a good way to prepare eggs in quantity&mdash;you can multiply the

softer finish than that of standard fried or poached eggs.</i></p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">Pepper</p>
<p class="t0">&frac14; C. half and half or light cream</p>
<p class="t0">4 tsp. butter, divided</p>

<p>Grease four ramekins, shallow baking dishes, or large custard cups. Break
and slip two eggs into each ramekin. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon 1
tablespoon half and half over each serving. Dot each with 1 teaspoon butter.</p>
<p>Bake in preheated 350&deg; F. oven until whites are set and yolks are soft and
creamy, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
<h3 id="c9">SOFT-COOKED EGGS</h3>
<p><i>Eggs started in unheated water are less apt to crack than ones put into boiling

<p>Put eggs in single layer in saucepan. Add enough tap water to come at least 1
inch above eggs. Cover and quickly bring just to boiling. Turn off heat. If
necessary, remove pan from burner to prevent further boiling. Let eggs stand
covered in the hot water 1 to 4 minutes, depending on desired doneness.
Immediately run cold water over eggs or put them in ice water until cool enough to
handle.</p>
<p>To serve, break shell through middle with a knife. With a teaspoon, scoop egg
out of each half shell into serving dish. To serve in an egg cup, put the egg in cup
small end down, slice off large end of egg with knife and eat from shell.</p>
<h3 id="c10">HARD-COOKED EGGS</h3>
<p><i>No wonder &ldquo;hard boiled&rdquo; has come to mean a tough character&mdash;boiling
toughens the delicate protein of egg. Gentler cooking pays off in tenderness. The
following method of turning the heat off when the water approaches the boiling
point has two advantages&mdash;it won&rsquo;t toughen the egg, and it saves energy.</i></p>

about 3 minutes for each size larger or smaller.) Immediately run cold water over
eggs or put them in ice water until completely cooled.</p>
<p>To remove shell, crack it by tapping gently all over. Roll egg between hands to
loosen shell, then peel, starting at large end. Hold egg under running cold water or

<p><span class="lr">4 servings</span></p>
<p><i>In the dining room of the Waldorf one day in 1894, an inventive but hungover
Lemuel Benedict created a dish that would forever bear his name. He put together
buttered toast, crisp bacon, poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce&mdash;and a classic
was born! Oscar of the Waldorf, a menu maker of the first order, altered the bacon
to ham and the toast to English muffins.</i></p>

Holland is famous for its butter, a main constituent of the sauce. Louis Diat, chef
extraordinaire and sauce expert formerly with New York City&rsquo;s Ritz Carlton,
wrote that &ldquo;if the sauce does curdle, you can bring it back to homogenous thickness
by putting a fresh egg yolk in another pan and gradually whipping in the curdled

<h4>TIPS ON MAKING MERINGUE</h4>
<p>When making meringues and some cakes, sugar is slowly added
to beaten egg whites. This serves to increase the stability of the foam.
Sugar, however, can retard the foaming of the whites.</p>
<p>If meringue pies weep, it is probably due to several different
problems: (1) overcooking (2) incomplete blending of
meringue (3) oven temperature too high (4) spreading the
meringue on a cold filling (5) overbeating before adding sugar.</p>

<p>Omelets, crepes, souffles, and quiches are becoming routine fare
in many homes because cooks have found they are actually simple to
prepare and can be combined with a great variety of other foods,
especially leftovers. Texans add hot sauces, jalapenos, fresh Texas
vegetables, and a range of meats to create Lone Star specials.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">Omelets</span></h2>
<h3 id="c29">FRENCH OR PLAIN OMELET</h3>

<p>Mix eggs, water, salt and pepper with fork. Heat butter in 8-inch omelet pan or
fry pan over medium-high heat until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Pour
in egg mixture. Mixture should set at edges at once. With pancake turner turned
over, carefully push cooked portions at edges toward center so uncooked portions
flow to bottom. Tilt pan as necessary so uncooked eggs can flow. Slide pan rapidly
back and forth over heat to keep mixture in motion and sliding freely. While top is
still moist and creamy-looking, fill, if desired. With pancake turner fold in half or
roll, turning out onto plate with a quick flip of the wrist.</p>
<p><b>Variations</b>: Omelets can be flavored with a variety of herbs and spices. Mix in
&#8539; to &frac14; teaspoon per omelet.</p>
<p>Omelets can hold almost any leftover food. For each omelet, fill with &#8531; to

<h4>Nutritional Quality of Eggs</h4>
<p>Eggs are especially rich in high-quality protein, unsaturated
fats, iron, phosphorus, trace minerals, vitamins A, E, and K, and all
B vitamins, including vitamin B 12. Eggs are second only to fish liver
oils as a natural source of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Two eggs are an economical means of adding a lot of nutritive
value to the menu. The price per two-egg servings of large eggs ranges
from 11 to 16 cents; for medium eggs, from 9&frac12; to 14 cents.</p>

<h4>SELECT TEXAS EGGS BY QUALITY</h4>
<p>Texas eggs which are sold in most retail outlets are either Grade
AA or Grade A. Both are ideal for any use, but are especially
desirable for poaching, frying, and cooking in the shell. A Grade AA
egg covers a small area; the white is thick and stands high; the yolk is
firm and high. A Grade A egg covers a moderate area; the white is
reasonably thick and stands fairly high; the yolk is firm and high.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of Agriculture maintains inspection
services for the Texas egg industry to make certain that quality and
size statements on the cartons are accurate. When you buy Texas
eggs, you can depend on getting the most for your money.</p>

<h4>STORING TEXAS EGGS</h4>
<p>The quality of Texas eggs will remain high for several weeks if they are
kept in a 45 to 55 degrees F. environment. Even under refrigeration, they
are slowly losing carbon dioxide and water, causing the yolks to flatten and
the whites to spread. Eggs kept outside the refrigerator at 72-80 degrees F.
will lose more quality in one day than they will lose in one week under
refrigeration.</p>

<h2 id="c60"><span class="small">Microwave Cooking</span></h2>
<h3 id="c61">GENERAL TIPS</h3>
<p class="revint">1. Don&rsquo;t try to cook an egg in the shell in the microwave.
It could explode.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Eggs continue to cook after they are removed from the microwave.
Take them out just before they are done.</p>
<h3 id="c62">FRYING EGGS</h3>
<p class="revint">1. Use a browning skillet.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Pierce the yolk in the shape of a cross to break the surface. This step
will eliminate the possibility of the yolk exploding.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Always place a glass of water in the microwave alongside the skillet.
The water will absorb some of the microwave, allowing the white and
yolk to cook at the same rate of speed.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Bacon cooked along with the egg helps retard overcooking of the yolk.</p>
<h3 id="c63">SCRAMBLING EGGS</h3>
<p class="revint">1. For a fluffier texture when scrambling eggs, remember to stir the egg
mixture frequently.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Don&rsquo;t overcook.</p>
<h3 id="c64">POACHING EGGS</h3>
<p class="revint">1. The eggs must be covered with water to assure even cooking.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Piercing the yolk in the shape of a cross to break the surface membrane
will eliminate the possibility of an explosion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact time of cooking eggs in a microwave oven will vary according
to the number of eggs to be prepared at one time and the size and
temperature of the eggs.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="box">
<h4>EGGS ARE ECONOMICAL</h4>
<p>Texas eggs are an economical means of adding a lot of nutritive
value to the menu. The price per two-egg servings of large eggs ranges
from 11 to 16 cents; for medium eggs, from 9&frac12; to 14 cents.</p>
